-- Basics
-- ------
-- 
-- At the very bottom of all hierarchies in Lean, we find data-carrying
-- classes. The following class records that the given type ``Œ±`` is endowed with
-- a distinguished element called ``one``. At this stage, it has no property at all.

class One (Œ± : Type) where
  /-- The element one -/
  one : Œ±

-- Since we'll make a much heavier use of classes in this chapter, we need to understand some
-- more details about what the ``class`` command is doing.
-- First, the ``class`` command above defines a structure ``One`` with parameter ``Œ± : Type`` and
-- a single field ``one``. It also marks this structure as a class so that arguments of type
-- ``One Œ±`` for some type ``Œ±`` will be inferrable using the instance resolution procedure,
-- as long as they are marked as instance-implicit, ie appear between square brackets.
-- Those two effects could also have been achieved using the ``structure`` command with ``class``
-- attribute, ie writing ``@[class] structure`` instance of ``class``. But the class command also
-- ensures that ``One Œ±`` appears as an instance-implicit argument in its own fields. Compare:

#check One.one -- lftcm.One.one {Œ± : Type} [self : One‚ÇÅ Œ±] : Œ±

@[class] structure One' (Œ± : Type) where
  /-- The element one -/
  one : Œ±

#check One'.one -- lftcm.One'.one {Œ± : Type} (self : One' Œ±) : Œ±

-- In the second check, we can see that ``self : One' Œ±`` is an explicit argument.
-- Let us make sure the first version is indeed usable without any explicit argument.

example (Œ± : Type) [One Œ±] : Œ± := One.one

-- Remark: in the above example, the argument ``One Œ±`` is marked as instance-implicit,
-- which is a bit silly since this affects only *uses* of the declaration and declaration created by
-- the ``example`` command cannot be used. However it allows to avoid giving a name to that
-- argument and, more importantly, it starts installing the good habit of marking ``One Œ±``
-- arguments as instance-implicit.
-- 
-- Another remark is that all this will work only when Lean knows what is ``Œ±``. In the above
-- example, leaving out the type ascription ``: Œ±`` would generate an error message like:
-- ``typeclass instance problem is stuck, it is often due to metavariables One (?m.263 Œ±)``
-- where ``?m.263 Œ±`` means "some type depending on ``Œ±``" (and 263 is simply an auto-generated
-- index that would be useful to distinguish between several unknown things). Another way
-- to avoid this issue would be to use a type annotation, as in:
example (Œ± : Type) [One Œ±] := (One.one : Œ±)

-- You may have already encountered that issue when playing with limits of sequences
-- in :numref:`sequences_and_convergence` if you tried to state for instance that
-- ``0 < 1`` without telling Lean whether you meant this inequality to be about natural numbers
-- or real numbers.
-- 
-- Our next task is to assign a notation to ``One.one``. Since we don't want collisions
-- with the builtin notation for ``1``, we will use ``ùüô``. This is achieved by the following
-- command where the first line tells Lean to use the documentation
-- of ``One.one`` as documentation for the symbol ``ùüô``.
@[inherit_doc]
notation "ùüô" => One.one

example {Œ± : Type} [One Œ±] : Œ± := ùüô

example {Œ± : Type} [One Œ±] : (ùüô : Œ±) = ùüô := rfl

-- We now want a data-carrying class recording a binary operation. We don't want to choose
-- between addition and multiplication for now so we'll use diamond.

class Dia (Œ± : Type) where
  dia : Œ± ‚Üí Œ± ‚Üí Œ±

infixl:70 " ‚ãÑ "   => Dia.dia

-- As in the ``One`` example, the operation has no property at all at this stage. Let us
-- now define the class of semigroup structures where the operation is denoted by ``‚ãÑ``.
-- For now, we define it by hand as a structure with two fields, a ``Dia`` instance and some
-- ``Prop``-valued field ``dia_assoc`` asserting associativity of ``‚ãÑ``.

class SemigroupDia (Œ± : Type) where
  toDia : Dia Œ±
  /-- Diamond is associative -/
  dia_assoc : ‚àÄ a b c : Œ±, a ‚ãÑ b ‚ãÑ c = a ‚ãÑ (b ‚ãÑ c)

-- Note that while stating `dia_assoc`, the previously defined field `toDia` is in the local
-- context hence can be used when Lean searches for an instance of `Dia Œ±` to make sense
-- of `a ‚ãÑ b`. However this `toDia` field does not become part of the type class instances database.
-- Hence doing ``example {Œ± : Type} [SemigroupDia Œ±] (a b : Œ±) : Œ± := a ‚ãÑ b`` would fail with
-- error message ``failed to synthesize instance Dia Œ±``.
-- 
-- We can fix this by adding the ``instance`` attribute later.

attribute [instance] SemigroupDia.toDia

example {Œ± : Type} [SemigroupDia Œ±] (a b : Œ±) : Œ± := a ‚ãÑ b

-- Before building up, we need a more convenient way to extend structures than explicitly
-- writing fields like `toDia` and adding the instance attribute by hand. The ``class``
-- supports this using the ``extends`` syntax as in:

class SemigroupDia' (Œ± : Type) extends Dia Œ± where
  /-- Diamond is associative -/
  dia_assoc : ‚àÄ a b c : Œ±, a ‚ãÑ b ‚ãÑ c = a ‚ãÑ (b ‚ãÑ c)

example {Œ± : Type} [SemigroupDia' Œ±] (a b : Œ±) : Œ± := a ‚ãÑ b

-- Note this syntax is also available in the ``structure`` command, although it that
-- case it fixes only the hurdle of writing fields such as `toDia` since there
-- is no instance to define in that case.
-- 
-- 
-- Let us now try to combine a diamond operation and a distinguished one with axioms saying
-- this element is neutral on both sides.
class DiaOneClass (Œ± : Type) extends One Œ±, Dia Œ± where
  /-- One is a left neutral element for diamond. -/
  one_dia : ‚àÄ a : Œ±, ùüô ‚ãÑ a = a
  /-- One is a right neutral element for diamond -/
  dia_one : ‚àÄ a : Œ±, a ‚ãÑ ùüô = a


-- In the next example, we tell Lean that ``Œ±`` has a ``DiaOneClass`` structure and state a
-- property that uses both a `Dia` instance and a `One` instance. In order to see how Lean finds
-- those instances we set a tracing option whose result can be seen in the info view. This result
-- is rather terse by default but can be expended by clicking one lines ending with black arrows.
-- It includes failed attempts where Lean tried to find instances before having enough type
-- information to succeed. The successful attempts do involve the instances generated by the
-- ``extends`` syntax.

set_option trace.Meta.synthInstance true in
example {Œ± : Type} [DiaOneClass Œ±] (a b : Œ±) : Prop := a ‚ãÑ b = ùüô

-- Note that we don't need to include extra fields where combining existing classes. Hence we can
-- define monoids as:

class MonoidDia (Œ± : Type) extends SemigroupDia Œ±, DiaOneClass Œ±

-- While the above definition seems straightforward, it hides an important subtlety. Both
-- ``SemigroupDia Œ±`` and ``DiaOneClass Œ±`` extend ``Dia Œ±``, so one could fear that having
-- a ``Monoid Œ±`` instance gives two unrelated diamond operations on ``Œ±``, one coming from
-- a field ``MonoidDia.toSemigroupDia`` and one coming from a field ``MonoidDia.toDiaOneClass``.
-- 
-- Indeed if we try to build a monoid class by hand using:

class MonoidDiaBad (Œ± : Type) where
  toSemigroupDia : Semigroup Œ±
  toDiaOneClass : DiaOneClass Œ±

-- then we get two completely unrelated diamond operations
-- ``MonoidDiaBad.toSemigroupDia.toDia.dia`` and ``MonoidDiaBad.toDiaOneClass.toDia.dia``.
-- 
-- The version generated using the ``extends`` syntax does not have this defect.

example {Œ± : Type} [MonoidDia Œ±] :
  (MonoidDia.toSemigroupDia.toDia.dia : Œ± ‚Üí Œ± ‚Üí Œ±) = MonoidDia.toDiaOneClass.toDia.dia := rfl

-- So the ``class`` command did some magic for us (and the ``structure`` command would have done it
-- too). An easy way to see what are the fields of our classes is to check their constructor. Compare:

/- lftcm.MonoidDiaBad.mk {Œ± : Type} (toSemigroupDia : Semigroup Œ±) (toDiaOneClass : DiaOneClass Œ±) : MonoidDiaBad Œ± -/
#check MonoidDiaBad.mk

/- lftcm.MonoidDia.mk {Œ± : Type} [toSemigroupDia : SemigroupDia Œ±] [toOne : One Œ±] (one_dia : ‚àÄ (a : Œ±), ùüô ‚ãÑ a = a)
  (dia_one : ‚àÄ (a : Œ±), a ‚ãÑ ùüô = a) : MonoidDia Œ±
-/
#check MonoidDia.mk

-- So we see that ``Monoid`` takes ``Semigroup Œ±`` argument as expected but then it won't
-- take a would-be overlapping ``DiaOneClass Œ±`` argument but instead tears it apart and includes
-- only the non-overlapping parts. And it also auto-generated an instance ``Monoid.toDiaOneClass``
-- which is *not* a field but has the expected signature which, from the end-user point of view,
-- restores the symmetry between the two extended classes ``Semigroup`` and ``DiaOneClass``.

#check MonoidDia.toSemigroupDia
#check MonoidDia.toDiaOneClass

-- We are now very close to defining groups. We could add to the monoid structure a field asserting
-- the existence of an inverse for every element. But then we would need to work to access these
-- inverses. In practice it is more convenient to add it as data. To optimize reusability,
-- we define a new data-carrying class, and then give it some notation.


class Inv (Œ± : Type) where
  /-- The inversion function -/
  inv : Œ± ‚Üí Œ±


@[inherit_doc]
postfix:max "‚Åª¬π" => Inv.inv

class GroupDia (G : Type) extends MonoidDia G, Inv G where
  inv_dia : ‚àÄ a : G, a‚Åª¬π ‚ãÑ a = ùüô

-- The above definition may seem too weak, we only ask that ``a‚Åª¬π`` is a left-inverse of ``a``.
-- But the other side is automatic. In order to prove that, we need a preliminary lemma.

lemma left_inv_eq_right_inv {M : Type} [MonoidDia M] {a b c : M} (hba : b ‚ãÑ a = ùüô) (hac : a ‚ãÑ c = ùüô) : b = c := by
  rw [‚Üê DiaOneClass.one_dia c, ‚Üê hba, SemigroupDia.dia_assoc, hac, DiaOneClass.dia_one b]

-- In this lemma, it is pretty annoying to give full names, especially since it requires knowing
-- which part of the hierarchy provides those facts. One way to fix this is to use the ``export``
-- command to copy those facts as lemmas in the root name space.

export DiaOneClass (one_dia dia_one)
export SemigroupDia (dia_assoc)
export GroupDia (inv_dia)

-- We can then rewrite the above proof as:

example {M : Type} [MonoidDia M] {a b c : M} (hba : b ‚ãÑ a = ùüô) (hac : a ‚ãÑ c = ùüô) : b = c := by
  rw [‚Üê one_dia c, ‚Üê hba, dia_assoc, hac, dia_one b]

-- At this stage we would like to move on to define rings, but there is a serious issue.
-- A ring structure on a type contains both an additive group structure and a multiplicative
-- monoid structure, and some properties about their interaction. But so far we hard-coded
-- a notation ``‚ãÑ`` for all our operations. More fundamentally, the type class system
-- assumes every type has only one instance of each type class. There are various
-- ways to solve this issue. Surprisingly Mathlib uses the naive idea to duplicate
-- everything for additive and multiplicative theories with the help of some code-generating
-- attribute. Structures and classes are defined in both additive and multiplicative notation
-- with an attribute ``to_additive`` linking them. In case of multiple inheritance like for
-- semi-groups, the auto-generated "symmetry-restoring" instances need also to be marked.
-- This is a bit technical you don't need to understand details. The important point is that
-- lemmas are then only stated in multiplicative notation and marked with the attribute ``to_additive``
-- to generate the additive version as ``left_inv_eq_right_inv'`` with it's auto-generated additive
-- version ``left_neg_eq_right_neg'``. In order to check the name of this additive version we
-- used the ``whatsnew in`` command on top of ``left_inv_eq_right_inv'``.

-- There is something interesting going on here. While it isn't too surprising that the

-- would have the signature appearing in the error message:
-- ``(R : Type) ‚Üí [inst : Ring R] ‚Üí {M : Type} ‚Üí [self : Module R M] ‚Üí AddCommGroup M``.
-- With such an instance in the type class database, each time Lean would look for a
-- ``AddCommGroup M`` instance for some ``M``, it would need to go hunting for a completely
-- unspecified type ``R`` and a ``Ring R`` instance before embarking on the main quest of finding a
-- ``Module R M`` instance. Those two side-quests are represented by the meta-variables mentioned in
-- the error message and denoted by ``?R`` and ``?inst‚úù`` there. Such a ``Module.toAddCommGroup``

-- whose end result ``SMul R M`` mentions both ``R`` and ``M`` so this field can
-- safely be used as an instance. The rule is easy to remember: each class appearing in the

-- A much more important issue is that we now have two module structures over the ring ``‚Ñ§``
-- for ``‚Ñ§`` itself: ``abGrpModule ‚Ñ§`` since ``‚Ñ§`` is a abelian group, and ``selfModule ‚Ñ§`` since
-- ``‚Ñ§`` is a ring. Those two module structure correspond to the same abelian group structure,
-- but it is not obvious that they have the same scalar multiplication. They actually do, but
-- this isn't true by definition, it requires a proof. This is very bad news for the type class
-- instance resolution procedure and will lead to very frustrating failures for users of this
-- hierarchy. When directly asked to find an instance, Lean will pick one, and we can see
-- which one using:

#synth Module ‚Ñ§ ‚Ñ§ -- abGrpModule ‚Ñ§

-- But in a more indirect context it can happen that Lean infers the one and then gets confused.
-- This situation is known as a bad diamond. This has nothing to do with the diamond operation
-- we used above, it refers to the way one can draw the paths from ``‚Ñ§`` to its ``Module ‚Ñ§``
-- going through either ``AddCommGroup ‚Ñ§`` or ``Ring ‚Ñ§``.
-- 
-- It is important to understand that not all diamonds are bad. In fact there are diamonds everywhere
-- in Mathlib, and also in this chapter. Already at the very beginning we saw one can go
-- from ``Monoid Œ±`` to ``Dia Œ±`` through either ``Semigroup Œ±`` or ``DiaOneClass Œ±`` and
-- thanks to the work done by the ``class`` command, the resulting two ``Dia Œ±`` instances
-- are definitionally equal. In particular a diamond having a ``Prop``-valued class at the bottom
-- cannot be bad since any too proofs of the same statement are definitionally equal.
-- 
-- But the diamond we created with modules is definitely bad. The offending piece is the ``smul``
-- field which is data, not a proof, and we have two constructions that are not definitionally equal.
-- The robust way of fixing this issue is to make sure that going from a rich structure to a
-- poor structure is always done by forgetting data, not by defining data. This well-known pattern
-- as been named "forgetful inheritance" and extensively discussed in
-- https://inria.hal.science/hal-02463336.
-- 
-- In our concrete case, we can modify the definition of ``AddMonoid`` to include a ``nsmul`` data
-- field and some ``Prop``-valued fields ensuring this operation is provably the one we constructed
-- above. Those fields are given default values using ``:=`` after their type in the definition below.
-- Thanks to these default values, most instances would be constructed exactly as with our previous
-- definitions. But in the special case of ``‚Ñ§`` we will be able to provide specific values.

-- Let us check we solved our issue. Because Lean already has a definition of scalar multiplication
-- of a natural number and an integer, and we want to make sure our instance is used, we won't use
-- the ``‚Ä¢`` notation but call ``SMul.mul`` and explicitly provide our instance defined above.

-- This story then continues with incorporating a ``zsmul`` field into the definition of groups
-- and similar tricks. You are now ready to read the definition of monoids, groups, rings and modules
-- in Mathlib. There are more complicated than what we have seen here, because they are part of a huge
-- hierarchy, but all principles have been explained above.
-- 
-- As an exercise, you can come back to the order relation hierarchy you built above and try
-- to incorporate a type class ``LT`` carrying the Less-Than notation ``<`` and make sure
-- that every preorder comes with a ``<`` which has a default value built from ``‚â§`` and a
-- ``Prop``-valued field asserting the natural relation between those two comparison operators.
